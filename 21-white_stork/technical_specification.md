# Synthetic Data Generator (White Stork)
**Epic Type:** Exploratory Epic

The goal is to create a prototype.

<!-- **Attention: Please do not put any confidential content here.** -->

## Principle Components of Exploration:

- Metadata generator based on GHGA model
    - Controlled vocabulary for CV fields
    - (Random but realistic) Value in non-CV data fields following right data type
    - Dataset generator
    - Submission JSON model
    - Post creation json model
    - Data model multiplicities
    - Connectivity of the classes
    - Realistic file name and size
- FASTQ file generator
    - Employ dummy_data_generator
    - Storage space requirements (platform selection: ABI cluster or de.NBI)
- Connection between metadata and file generators for file related parameters
- Run time - Not a focus on the performance, but aim for reasonable

## User Journeys

This epic covers the following user journeys:

### User reguests both metadata and correspoding files
