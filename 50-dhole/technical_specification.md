# Rewriting existing metldata transformations
**Epic Type:** Implementation Epic

Epic planning and implementation follow the
[Epic Planning and Marathon SOP](https://docs.ghga-dev.de/main/sops/sop001_epic_planning.html).

**Attention: Please do not put any confidential content here.**

## Scope
### Outline:
The aim is to rewrite all existing metldata transformations to use schemapack.


### Included/Required:
- add possibility to use custom embedding profile to configure the denormalization
  in schemapack
- migrating the already schemapack-based transformations to spec version 0.2.0
  (see https://github.com/ghga-de/metldata/tree/poc/src/metldata/schemapack_/builtin_transformations):
  - delete_properties
  - infer_relations
- re-implement the following LinkML-based transformations to use schemapack
  (see https://github.com/ghga-de/metldata/tree/poc/src/metldata/builtin_transformations):
  - merge_slots
- re-evaluate and potentially refactor the following transformations:
  - aggregate
  - normalize_model


### Not included:
- Reimplementation of the custom_ebeddings transformation is not required since it will already
  covered by builtin functionality of schemapack
- Reimplementation of the add_accessions transformation is postponed since it might be
  moved handled by the submission store and not be implemented as transformation.
- A full reimplementation of the GHGA transformation workflow (this depends on other changes to
  be in place first and would make this epic dependent on other lines of work).

## Additional Details:

### Embedding Profile to Configure Denormalization:
TBD.

## Human Resource/Time Estimation:

Number of sprints required: 2

Number of developers required: 1
