# Monorepo Setup for Multiple Microservices
**Epic Type:** Exploratory Epic

Epic planning and implementation follows the
[Epic Planning and Marathon SOP](https://docs.ghga-dev.de/main/sops/sop001_epic_planning.html)

**Attention: Please do not put any confidential content here.**

## Principle Components of Exploration:

This epic aims at the establishment of a monorepo template that can be used to host
multiple microservices. Specifically, it shall satisfy the requirements imposed by 
our file-service setup and a microservice-based version of metldata.

Specifically, the following questions shall be answered:

- How to manage the life cycle of individual services? Specifically regarding versioning
  and releases.
    - We can start by evaluating whether a simple setup in which all services are
      versioned and releases together is sufficient.
- How to manage dependencies for individual services?
    - One pyproject.toml and lock file per service?
    - One global lock file for keeping dependencies shared between services in sync?
    - One docker container per service?
- Overall directory structure? Clarifying where following files and directories are
  located:
    - src dirs for individual services
    - pyproject.tomls
    - example_config.yaml / config_schema.json
    - openapi.yaml
    - Readme(s) (per service or one global?)
    - scripts (e.g. update template script)
    - .devcontainer
    - python tooling settings (linters, formatters, etc.)
    - tests (unit, service-wise API testing, inter-service integration testing, etc.)
- Which types of tests are required in the mono-repo?
    - unit tests (per service)
    - service-wise API tests (conformance tests)
    - inter-service integration tests
        - Behavioral
        - contract-testing
        - black and/or white box
- How to ensure that microservice boundraries are respected?
    - import analysis?
    - flag PRs that add changes to multiple repositories
    - relying on disciplin?
- How to deal with shared functionality?
    - e.g. in addition to services allow libraries in the monorepo
- Branching and release strategy?
- Is frontend part of a monorepo? I.e. vertical slice architecture?
    - In that case, how to manage authentication?

## Additional Implementation Details:

Moving the existing file services into a monorepo might serve as a good proof of
concept as these services are fully evolved and understood.


## Human Resource/Time Estimation:

Number of sprints required: 1
