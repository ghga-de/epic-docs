# Hexkit Documentation (Pygmy Goat)
**Epic Type:** Implementation Epic

Epic planning and implementation follow the
[Epic Planning and Marathon SOP](https://docs.ghga-dev.de/main/sops/sop001_epic_planning.html).

## Scope
### Outline:
`Hexkit` currently has very little documentation regarding its use, terminology,
or architectural concepts. Some of this knowledge *is* documented in an unconsolidated
fashion, with files spread across Confluence, Google Docs, and the internal docs
site. However, developers or even hypothetical third parties working with or
contributing to `hexkit` do not currently have access to the comprehensive and
consolidated documentation that the library warrants. This epic will remedy that.
The aggregated documentation can be located within the library as a README or within
an external service, such as the internal docs site.


### Included/Required:
The following points should be covered in the documentation:
- Glossary
- Update, improve and expand the existing code in the examples directory
  - Document these examples, and add some more usage examples if needed
- Architectural Concepts (Triple Hexagonal Architecture, DLQ, Outbox, DAOs, etc.) Testing Tools (persistent vs clean fixtures, session-scoped containers, etc.)
- Requirements for adding new functionality, e.g. new protocols or new DAO providers
- Auto-generated API reference docs


### Additional Implementation Details

    - Test utilities
      - Container fixture and fixture reset/cleanup function
      - Accompanying fixtures/utilities
  - Kafka
    - Overview
    - Outbox Pattern
    - Persistent Publisher
    - When to use outbox vs persistent publisher
    - DLQ
    - Test utilities
      - Container fixture and fixture reset/cleanup function
  - MongoDB
    - Overview
    - Role in outbox pattern
    - Role in persistent publisher
    - Migration Tools
    - Test utilities
      - Container fixture and fixture reset/cleanup function
- Adding providers
- Glossary
- Usage Examples should include the following, if they don't already:
  - Basic Kafka Pub/Sub
  - Basic DAO
  - Basic S3
  - Dependency Injection (as in most of our `inject.py` modules)
  - Logging
  - Correlation IDs
  - Migration Tools
- Logging
- Correlation IDs
