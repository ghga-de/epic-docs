# Data Portal Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Semantics Overhaul and SOPs (Miniature Horse)
**Epic Type:** Implementation Epic

Epic planning and implementation follow the
[Epic Planning and Marathon SOP](https://docs.ghga-dev.de/main/sops/sop001_epic_planning.html).

## Scope
### Outline:
This epic seeks to perform two tasks in three different domains.  
These domains are: accessibility, responsiveness, and semantics.

The first task of this epic relates to the overhaul of the data portal to improve its accessibility and semantics, as well as attempt to standardise the implementation of its responsiveness.

The second task is that of creating documentation and SOPs for best practices in the implementation of accessibility, responsiveness, and semantics in the data portal.

### Included/Required:
- The data portal should be fully compliant with the European Accessibility Act (EAA, which also makes reference to EN 301 549), and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
- The data portal should make full use of semantic tags and aria attributes whenever applicable.
- The data portal should implement responsiveness in a more standardised manner that nevertheless remains suited for the specific purpose of the elements to make responsive.
- Developers should have available documentation and SOPs for best practices on the implementation of accessibility, responsiveness, and semantics, as well as for ensuring that any new features to be released are accessibility-compliant.

### Optional:
- Developers should have available a list of useful tools and extensions to better implement accessibility features.

### Not included:
- The development of our own accessibility standards; only best practices for implementing legally required and any additional standards.

## User Journeys (optional)

This epic covers the following user journeys:

- Screen reader users should be able to navigate and use all available features of the data portal with minimal .
- Users with limited vision should be able to easily navigate and use all available features of the data portal (to verify with high-contrast settings).
- Users with limited or no perception of colour should be able to easily navigate and use all available features of the data portal (to verify with colourblind settings)
