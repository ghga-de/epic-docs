Documentation and plans for service development epics.

There are two different types of epics: Exploratory Epics and Implementation Epics.

Please have a look at the templates ([exploratory](./template_exploratory_epic), [implementation](./template_implementation_epic)) and especially the contained technical specifications ([exploratory](./template_exploratory_epic/technical_specification.md), [implementation](./template_implementation_epic/technical_specification.md)).

This repository is part of the *Epic Planning and Marathon SOP* which can be found here: https://wiki.verbis.dkfz.de/x/fwDiCQ
